This repository contains a Dockerfile with a common error: a missing requirements.txt file. The initial Dockerfile attempts to install dependencies using pip3 install -r requirements.txt, but the requirements.txt file is not included in the build context. This results in a build failure.  The solution demonstrates the proper inclusion of the requirements.txt file in the Docker build context.
